				We love our home and have put a lot of effort in to upgrading it, but unfortunately with our space-occupying hobbies, working from home, and a growing family, we've found we need to look for more space :(. We've decided the time has come for us to move on. We take pride in the love and care we've given to this home, and if you're interested in purchasing then we hope you'll have many very happy years here too.
			</p>

			<p>
				The location couldn't be better (in our opinion). It's close enough to Bank and Lansdowne that you're only steps from pleasant, high-energy places with great amenities, while at home it feels peaceful. The canal is only a block and a half away.
			</p>

			<p>
				See <a href="https://vimeo.com/133522557">this walk-through video</a> from 2016. Since then we've done both exterior and interior painting and made a few other changes that are aesthetically minor, but have a large impact on the state of the house. We're happy to give tours and allow inspections and quotes for work, etc.
